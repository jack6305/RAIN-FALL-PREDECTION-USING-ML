Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning 

Overview  
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning models. The goal is to analyze historical weather data and build a model that forecasts rainfall based on features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.  

 Features  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Training machine learning models  
- Model evaluation and performance analysis  


 Usage  
- Load the dataset and preprocess the data  
- Train different ML models and compare their performance  
- Predict rainfall using the best-performing model  

 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
